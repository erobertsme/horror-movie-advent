# Horror Movie Advent
This is a small set of PHP pages to display and allow easy editing of a Horror movie advent calendar.

### How to use
Basic common sense is required. I don't really want to write out each detail on how to use such a simple set of pages.
Upload files to any directory you'd like on a PHP compatible server.
Copy `options.sample.php` to `options.php` and set the password constant.
To view the list users will navigate to the base directory the files were uploaded to.
To edit the list users will navigate to `/edit.php` of the base directory the files were uploaded to, and must use the password defined in the constant in `options.php`.
